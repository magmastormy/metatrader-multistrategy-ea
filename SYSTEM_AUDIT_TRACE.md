## Runtime Lifecycle

### 1. OnInit
- Validate terminal and trading permissions.
- Initialize execution/risk systems.
- Emit explicit `[EXECUTION-MODE]` startup telemetry for shadow vs live posture.
- Reject unsupported non-hedging account models before runtime ownership is established.
- Apply execution safety controls (fill mode, slippage, protective modify cooldown) before trade-manager bootstrap.
- Initialize AI subsystems conditionally by flags.
- Initialize performance analytics before unified-risk bootstrap.
- Build per-symbol managers and strategy registrations.
- Register orchestrator strategy identities.

### 2. Tick/Timer cycle
- Run `ProcessTradingLogic`.
- Maintain NN learning cycle.
- Enforce terminal connectivity gate before signal evaluation.
- Enforce deterministic second-level signal evaluation separation between tick/timer events.
- Run deterministic unprotected-position remediation sweep before entry evaluation.
- Rotate symbol evaluation start index each cycle to reduce fixed-order concentration.
- Detect new-bar events per symbol.
- Run intrabar scans when eligible.
- Emit heartbeat funnel and conversion-rate telemetry at configured diagnostics interval.

### 3. Signal path
- Manager consensus + confluence.
- Manager applies role/cluster governance and evaluates quorum via normalized weighted confidence pooling.
- Manager quorum requires `InpMinLiveVoters` floor and `InpQuorumThreshold` pass; intrabar single-voter output still requires configured minimum confidence.
- Manager vote admission now uses the pipeline's effective confidence floor for the current evaluation, avoiding pipeline/quorum drift when regime-aware relaxation is active.
- Manager emits consensus root-cause attribution snapshots for no-signal diagnostics.
- Manager emits strategy-level none-reason attribution for core curated contributors.
- Pipeline now includes deterministic regime/cost viability gate before validator.
- Pipeline threshold adaptation now uses `CRegimeEngine` snapshot state and dedicated non-AI confidence floors instead of AI-threshold coupling.
- Validation profile checks (confidence + confluence + quality by scan mode: new-bar vs intrabar).
- Risk gating (pre-size then post-size).
- Risk gate now evaluates cluster governance (mutex + caps) using request context and open-position cluster tags.
- Pipeline confidence gate emits threshold-source metadata and uses bounded weak-regime intrabar uplift.
- Trend ADX failures degrade to neutral/ranging context with bounded ADX-handle self-heal.
- ATR stop-distance fallback when indicator read fails.
- Shadow or live execution branch.
- Per-symbol capacity checks include explicit external-position block telemetry.

### 4. Post-trade path
- Transaction callback updates manager/orchestrator performance.
- Transaction callback records confirmed close results into `PerformanceAnalytics`.
- NN attribution maps prediction IDs and labels closes (online-training gate controlled).

### 5. Housekeeping
- Position manager lifecycle actions.
- Periodic telemetry logs.
- Indicator cache release policy.

### 6. OnDeinit
- Release managers and dynamic strategy allocations.
- Deinitialize subsystems.
- Explicit `CIndicatorManager::DestroyInstance()`.
- Orchestrator report emission is single-source (destructor-owned) to avoid duplicate shutdown reports.
- **Memory Safety**: AI adapters now properly clean up transformer models in destructors.
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced validation in feature vector construction and attribution systems.

## Observability Surface
- Decision: `[SIGNAL]`, `[SIGNAL-REJECTED]`, `[SIGNAL-VALIDATED]`
- System telemetry: `[EXECUTION-MODE]`, `[HEARTBEAT]`, `[HEARTBEAT-FUNNEL]`, `[CONVERSION-RATES]`, `[RISK-BUDGET]`, `[CONSENSUS-QUORUM]`, `[CONSENSUS-DIAG]`, `[CONSENSUS-ROOT]`, `[CONSENSUS-SNAPSHOT]`, `[CONSENSUS-STRATEGY]`, `[CONSENSUS-ROLE]`, `[CONSENSUS-CLUSTER]`, `[ROLE-CLUSTER]`, `[STRATEGY-REJECTS]`, `[PIPELINE-THRESHOLD]`, `[REGIME-STATE]`, `[COST-GATE]`, `[ENTRY-VETO]`, `[QUIET-REASONS]`, `[NO-SIGNAL-ALERT]`, `[TRADE-CONFIRMED]`
- Risk remediation: `[RISK-UNPROTECTED]`, `[CAPACITY-EXTERNAL]`, `[RISK-CLUSTER]`, `[RISK-MUTEX-BLOCK]`
- AI: `[AI-VOTE]`, `[NN-HEALTH]`
- Trade: `[SHADOW-TRADE]`, `[TRADE-SUCCESS]`, `[TRADE-ERROR]`

## Current Operational Constraints
- Persistent terminal sessions are preferred.
- Start tester on stable history symbol (`EURUSD.0`) when synthetic history is uncertain.
- Emergency drawdown flattening can run account-wide when configured (`InpEmergencyFlattenAllAccountPositions=true`).

## Build Note
- Compile helper: `sync_and_compile.ps1`
- Compile artifacts should be auto-cleaned after runs unless explicitly retained.
- **Code Quality**: Recent fixes address memory leaks, null pointer safety, bounds checking, and standardized constants across AI components.
- **Compilation**: Verified 0 errors, 0 warnings with all improvements integrated.

## 2026-02-24 Cleanup Trace
- Removed dead commented strategy stubs from `MultiStrategyAutonomousEA.mq5`.
- Removed orphan harmonic strategy component files under `Strategies/HarmonicFiles/`.
- Removed dead wrapper files carrying legacy `StrategySwing` naming:
  - `Core/Utils/File.mqh`
  - `Core/Trading/DealInfo.mqh`
  - `Core/Trading/HistoryOrderInfo.mqh`
  - `Core/Trading/PositionInfo.mqh`
- Pruned retired strategy enum references from `Core/Utils/Enums.mqh`.
- Removed unused legacy strategy configuration module `Config/StrategyConfig.mqh`.
- Normalized Unified ICT helper comments/diagnostics to remove legacy SMC-era naming.

## 2026-02-24 Throughput-Recovery Trace
- Added intrabar dynamic quorum controls and single-voter confidence floor controls in `EnterpriseStrategyManager`.
- Added explicit strategy-level intrabar eligibility assignment path for curated core contributors.
- Added manager-level consensus funnel snapshots and dominant-cause diagnostics (`[CONSENSUS-ROOT]`).
- Added per-strategy reject attribution counters and heartbeat aggregation (`[CONSENSUS-STRATEGY]`, `[STRATEGY-REJECTS]`).
- Hardened `TrendEngine` ADX handling with readiness checks, value-domain sanitation, neutral degrade, and bounded ADX handle reinit.
- Extended pipeline confidence filtering with bounded weak-regime intrabar threshold cap plus source-tag logging.
- Extended heartbeat with conversion funnel counters/rates and no-signal dominance alerting tied to consensus diagnostics.

## 2026-03-07 No-Trade Recovery Trace
- Refined `EnterpriseStrategyManager` intrabar dynamic quorum so it now keys off actual live contributors in the current cycle rather than the entire eligible live pool.
- Added explicit `[EXECUTION-MODE]` startup telemetry in `MultiStrategyAutonomousEA.mq5` to prevent shadow-mode sessions from being mistaken for execution failures.
- Initialized `PerformanceAnalytics` explicitly before `CUnifiedRiskManager` bootstrap to remove cold-start ambiguity in adaptive-risk wiring.
- Split non-AI signal confidence policy away from `InpAIConfidenceThreshold` by introducing dedicated pipeline and validator confidence floors in `MultiStrategyAutonomousEA.mq5`.
- Rewired `CUnifiedSignalPipeline` threshold adaptation to use `CRegimeEngine` snapshot state rather than `TrendEngine` neutral/warmup output.
- Added explicit `Trend` reject telemetry so primary-live starvation can be diagnosed from runtime logs instead of remaining silent.

## 2026-03-07 Execution-Safety Trace
- Switched `CTradeManager` market sends to synchronous execution by default.
- Reworked market send path so execution price and protective SL/TP are recalculated from current market data at submit time.
- Moved confirmed close analytics updates into `OnTradeTransaction` and strengthened `PerformanceAnalytics::RecordClosedTrade(...)`.
- Reconstructed `AdvancedPositionManager` partial-close and breakeven state for already-open positions using `POSITION_IDENTIFIER` plus history-derived entry volume.
- Rejected unsupported non-hedging account modes at startup and tightened symbol validation for close-only symbols and invalid volume-step specs.

## 2026-03-16 Timeframe + AI Feedback Trace
- Manager consensus now resolves mixed-timeframe conflicts using `CTimeframeConsistency`.
- Strategy `OnNewBar` dispatch uses each strategy's registered timeframe to prevent cross-timeframe misalignment.
- AI performance feedback now records prediction/outcome pairs using request-to-position mapping on live trades.

## 2026-03-24 Quorum Admission Alignment + Smoke Controls Trace
- Aligned `EnterpriseStrategyManager` vote admission with `UnifiedSignalPipeline`'s effective confidence floor so pipeline-approved relaxed-threshold signals remain eligible for timeframe consistency and quorum.
- Added opt-in intrabar eligibility controls for `Fibonacci` and `Support/Resistance` to support smoke tests that need the chain to reach validator/risk/execution without broadening production defaults.

## 2026-03-16 Weighted Quorum + Live Strategy Promotion Trace
- Promoted all retained strategies to live primary voters by default (per-strategy inputs gate registration).
- Replaced binary count-based quorum with normalized weighted confidence quorum (`InpQuorumThreshold`, `InpMinLiveVoters`, per-strategy `InpWeight*`).
- Added per-evaluation quorum telemetry via `[CONSENSUS-QUORUM]`.

## 2026-02-24 Strategy Betterment Trace
- Note: the soft-quarantine defaults recorded in this batch are historical; current default voting behavior is defined by the 2026-03-16 weighted quorum + live strategy promotion update.
- Added institutional strategy governance metadata (role, cluster, live-vote eligibility, shadow mode) to `EnterpriseStrategyManager` and exposed setter APIs by strategy name.
- Added soft-quarantine defaults in EA initialization:
  - primary live voters: `Momentum`, `Trend`, `Unified ICT`
  - feature/shadow-only by default: `Candlestick`, `Fibonacci`, `Elliott Wave`, `Support/Resistance`
- Added deterministic `Core/Engines/RegimeEngine.mqh` and integrated it into `UnifiedSignalPipeline` as a pre-validator regime/cost viability gate.
- Extended `SignalFilterSettings` with regime/cost controls (`enableRegimeCostGate`, `maxSpreadToAtrRatio`, `spreadShockCooldownSeconds`, `maxEntryRangeZScore`).
- Refactored momentum strategy to state+trigger gating (EMA state alignment + compression-to-break trigger) to reduce crossover spam.
- Simplified Unified ICT live decision path to falsifiable event tuple checks (structure break, displacement, mitigation/retest) with bounded event-quality scoring.
- Extended `STradeValidationRequest` with role/cluster/contributor context and compact cluster code.
- Added cluster-aware risk governance in `RiskValidationGate`:
  - same-symbol opposing-cluster mutex
  - per-cluster concurrent position cap
  - per-cluster projected risk cap
- Added runtime cluster-tagged trade comments (`K:T/R/S/N`) for deterministic cluster attribution on open positions.
